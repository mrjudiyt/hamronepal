  Hamro Nepal is a minimal Nepali Calendar App that can sync with your Google account and can be installed on any operating system as a progressive web app. 

It is completely open-source and free to use without any ads. But why did we create yet another Nepali Calendar App when there are already so many of them? Two main reasons, theyâ€™re too bloated and they fail to become a good calendar, i.e. to cross-compatibility with other calendars.  Hamro Nepal can be operated in sync with native calendar apps in any OS because almost all of them support google calendar.
